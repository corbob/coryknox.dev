For a while at Chocolatey, we have had a Slack channel for things we learned.
For almost as long I have been meaning to add a post about the things I learned to my blog.
Recently, [Julia Evans](https://jvns.ca/) shared about her creation of a small ["TIL" section](https://jvns.ca/blog/2024/11/09/new-microblog/) on her site.

With that in mind, I have created a "TIL" tag on my blog, as well as redirecting https://coryknox.dev/til to the listing page for the tag.

Also at Julia's encouragement, I have created a PowerShell script that will create a new page for me and open the file in vscode.

Title: "Announcing #BridgeConf"
---

What is the best part of the PowerShell community?
That's an excellent question.
As a community, we have numerous places to gather and exchange ideas, obtain advice, share our expertise, form relationships that extend beyond the confines of an office building.

<!--more-->

## The Why

One of those places is [Discord](https://pwsh.ca/discord) and [Slack](https://pwsh.ca/slack) as well as on Freenode in the #powershell channel.
The Discord and Slack are bridged together by a bot.
This bot also loops in Freenode in a channel known as #bridge.
This community is far and away the most accepting and helpful community I have found online.
At any given time there are people there to answer questions (sometimes more than just PowerShell).

## The What

![#BridgeConf]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/BridgeConf-Details.png)

As a way to celebrate the spirit of #bridge in the time of COVID-19 and social distancing making in-person events non-existent, we are excited to announce #BridgeConf.
 #BridgeConf is a one-day single track livestreamed conference-style event for PowerShell, automation, programming, infrastructure, sysadmin, and other miscellaneous nerds around the world.
This event doesnâ€™t have a singular focus, but it is born from the PowerShell Discord/Slack community.

## The When

April 30, 2020 from 08:00 PDT until approximately 17:15 PDT (that's 8:00 AM until 5:15 PM).

## The Where

This entirely virtual conference will be livestreamed to [Twitch.tv](https://twitch.tv/bridgeconf).
Following the conference, we will be doing our best to edit and split the stream into it's corresponding sessions to be posted online.

## The Who

Hopefully you!
Seriously, we need you and others like you to submit proposals for sessions.
[The Call for Proposals is open](https://papercall.io/bridgeconf).
So get out there and submit a proposal.
Have you have done something recently that you are excited about?
Are you currently working on a project that is bending PowerShell in ways you never thought possible?
Are you just learning PowerShell and want to share your knowledge with others?
We want to hear about it!

We are not interested in just "300 level" content.
Not everyone in the PowerShell community are pushing the boundaries.
Some of us are just learning.
Some of us have been doing this for a while.

Even those of us that have been doing this for a decade constantly learn new things.
As an example: at last year's PowerShell Summit, [Tyler Leonhardt](https://twitter.com/TylerLeonhardt) gave a talk titled [Using Visual Studio Code as Your Default PowerShell Editor](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bGn45vIeAMM).
Now I've contributed to the PowerShell extension for Visual Studio.
I've been using it for years.
And I learned stuff in watching the talk.
If I can learn something about a tool that I use nearly daily, and in fact contribute to, then so can you!
